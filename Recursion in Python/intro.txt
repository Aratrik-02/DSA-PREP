What is recursion?
->Recursion in data structure is when a function calls itself indirectly or directly, and the function      calling itself is known as a recursive function. It's generally used when the answer to a larger issue could be depicted in terms of smaller problems.

->There are 5 types of recursion. Let’s discuss one by one,

   > Direct Recursion.
   > Indirect Recursion.
   > Tail Recursion.
   > Non-Tail / Head Recursion.
   > Linear Recursion.

A quote for you,
“Preoccupied with a single leaf... you won't see the tree. Preoccupied with a single tree... you'll miss the entire forest. Don't be preoccupied with a single spot. See everything in it's entirety... effortlessly. That is what it means to truly "see.” ~miyamoto musashi(writer of vagabond)
