## **Trees**
A tree is a popular data structure that is non-linear in nature. Unlike other data structures like array, stack, queue, and linked list which are linear in nature, a tree represents a hierarchical structure. The ordering information of a tree is not important. A tree contains nodes and 2 pointers. These two pointers are the left child and the right child of the parent node.
